## Summary
#### This objective of this projective was to develop models to predict and explain an NBA player's first contact after his rookie contract.  In addition to developing a robust model with practical uses in the real world, another purpose to review the benefit of using an ensemble model approach over a general OLS model.

## Files
#### Capstone Scraping.ipynb - contains the data scraping code used to pull down the data from BasketballReference.com that was used as the basis for the dataframe used for the model.
#### SalaryCapHistory - contains historical NBA salary cap information so that all NBA salaries could be converted into 2018 dollars in the final dataframe.
#### test_player_dataframe_1.txt - stores the data from the scraping code for ease of repeated access.
